# todo-app

Phase 1 Requirements
In Phase 1, we’re going to perform some refactoring of the To Do application as built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.

- [] Style the application using the Blueprint Component API{target:_blank}
  `npm install @blueprintjs/core`

- [] Properly modularize the application into separate components

- [] Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components

  - [] How many To Do Items to show at once
  - [] Whether or not to show completed items

Technical Requirements / Notes
Create a settings Context that can define how our components should display elements to the User.

- [] Implement the React context API for defining settings across the entire application.

  - Create a context for managing application display settings and provide this at the application level.

  - Display or Hide completed items (boolean).
  - Number of items to display per screen (number).
  - Default sort field (string).
  - Manually set (hard code) those state settings in the context provider’s state, they should not be changeable.

- [] Consume and utilize context values throughout your components
  - Show a maximum of a certain number of items per screen in the `<List />` component

    - Provide “next” and “previous” links to let the users navigate a long list of items

  - Hide or show completed items in the list
  - Optional: Sort the items based on any of the keys (i.e. difficulty)

Pagination Notes:

- Only display the first n items in the list, where n is the number to display per screen in your context.

  - If you have more than n items in the list, add a button labeled Next that will replace the list with the next n items in the list.
  - If you are past the first n items (i.e. on page 2 or higher), add a button labeled Previous that will replace the list with the previous n items in the list.

Testing

- Tests should assert all behavioral functionality

- Do a deep mount of the app, and set tests to make assertions on the child components that consume context from the Provider.
  - Can they see context?
